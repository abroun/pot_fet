A simple one page app that consumes the Flickr public feed.

Running the Project
-------------------

In general this is just a standard Grunt project so run

    grunt serve

to run a development server. However, a PHP server is also needed as
this project uses a simple proxy to avoid the CORS error that arises
when trying to use the Flickr api directly. Therefore, run the following
to start a simple PHP server for dev purposes

    cd app
    php -S localhost:8888

TODO: It's a bit clunky having to start a separate dev PHP server. So it
might be worthwhile looking at a more sophisticated solution such as
